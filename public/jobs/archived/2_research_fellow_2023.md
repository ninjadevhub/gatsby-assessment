<h2 class="mb-4 text-blue-500 h4 font-playfair-display"">Why Rho Impact</h2>
If you are excited about gaining experience assessing the potential for new technologies to avoid future GHG emissions, working with businesses to help them understand their climate impact, and developing data science tools to advance sustainability, then this opportunity may be a good fit for you!

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 class="mb-4 text-blue-500 h4 font-playfair-display"">The Opportunity:</h2>

Rho Impact is accepting applications for our Spring 2023 cohort of Impact Research Fellows to become expert practitioners of our open-source <a href="https://cranetool.rog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 group">CRANE tool</a>, developed in partnership with Prime Coalition and made possible through grants provided by the MacArthur Foundation, MassCEC, and NYSERDA. CRANE informs early-stage businesses and investors about the potential for new technologies to reduce or avoid future emissions. The goal of the CRANE software is to greatly decrease the time and resources required for investors, entrepreneurs, government agencies, incubators, and philanthropies to perform forward-looking, rigorous and transparent climate impact assessments. The key result is an emissions reduction potential (ERP) for the technology or company, which is the magnitude of the greenhouse gas emissions in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) that can be avoided or abated as a result of deploying the new technology.

<br/>
<br/>

Impact Research Fellows will learn how to build technical solution models of low-GHG technologies and relevant markets through secondary research and engage in peer-review of one anotherâ€™s models. Following a paid training period, fellows will have the opportunity to engage with Rho Impact clients to perform CRANE ERP analyses with the support of the Rho Impact team.

<br/>
<br/>

This is a part-time, remote position with a minimum duration of 8 weeks. <span class="font-semibold">Fellows will be paid a stipend for completion of the 8-week training program (averaging approx. 5 hours per week) and may then be invited to continue work as a contractor with Rho Impact whereby they will be compensated for each individual analysis.</span>
