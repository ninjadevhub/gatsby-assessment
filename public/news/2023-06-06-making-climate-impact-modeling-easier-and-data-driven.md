blurb: VCs love data. They use it to decide who to invest in, which companies to
  pass on and which markets to focus on. Their vocabulary is made up of the KPIs
  they appreciate most, from EBIT and CAC, to LTV and TAM (thatâ€™s earnings
  before interest and tax, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value and total
  addressable market, to everyone else).
