blurb: We're thrilled to announce our partnership with Brinc, a Hong-Kong based
  accelerator with programs across seven countries. We will be leading impact
  measurement workshops for Brinc's climate tech and food tech accelerator
  programs, including teaching expert usage of the CRANE Tool (Carbon Reduction
  Assessment for New Enterprises). Partnered with global corporations (like
  Manulife, Huawei, Schneider Electric, PUMA Group, Merck) and civic
  institutions (like NEOM and National University of Singapore), we look forward
  to supporting Brinc's mission to empower global game changers.
