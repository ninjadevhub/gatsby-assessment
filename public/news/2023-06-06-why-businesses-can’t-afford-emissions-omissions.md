blurb: "In short, the proposed changes would require that publicly traded
  companies disclose the climate impact of, and carbon emitted from, their
  business operations. Specifically, the SEC called for reporting of three types
  of emissions: Scope 1 emissions, which are produced from sources directly
  controlled by a company, such as fleet vehicles; Scope 2, which are associated
  with  purchased electricity and other energy; and Scope 3, which represent the
  emissions produced not directly by that company but that occur elsewhere in
  the supply chain as a result of the company’s actions."
