blurb: Corporate governance is a system that guides the conduct of the people
  within an organization, as well as the direction of the organization itself.
  Corporate governance is altogether different from the daily operational
  decisions and activities that are executed by the management of an
  organization. Corporate governance is the domain of the Board of Directors, as
  opposed to its management team (such as the CEO and other C-suite executives).
