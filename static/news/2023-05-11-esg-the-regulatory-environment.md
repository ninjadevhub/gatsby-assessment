blurb: A rising focus on corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance
  (ESG) performance is rapidly changing the regulatory environment and
  associated stakeholder expectations for businesses around the world.
  Investors, analysts, directors, and management teams alike are seeing the need
  to apply an ESG lens to virtually every decision-making process — from where
  to deploy capital and who to partner with to which new markets to enter.
