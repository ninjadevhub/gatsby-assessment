blurb: Publicly traded companies have been slow to adopt net-zero emissions
  goals, but corporate peer pressure combined with regulatory changes is
  beginning to turn the tide. Only 37% of about 5,300 companies reviewed in the
  2021 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment had announced plans to
  reduce Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions.
