blurb: In March, the SEC proposed rules that would mandate enhanced
  climate-related disclosures by public companies. These rules arguably would be
  the most significant new public company disclosure and compliance requirements
  in a generation. By the time the comment period closed on June 17, the SEC had
  received approximately 14,000 comment letters. In this analysis, we provide
  statistics on the comment letters and note some of the many significant
  comment letters submitted.
