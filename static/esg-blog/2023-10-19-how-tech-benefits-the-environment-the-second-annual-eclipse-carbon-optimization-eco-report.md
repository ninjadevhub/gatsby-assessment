blurb: Central to Rho Impact’s mission is promoting the widespread adoption of
  open and transparent forecasting approaches. We believe this is key to
  enabling industries worldwide to allocate the trillions of dollars required to
  combat climate change in a way that is auditable, robust, and universally
  comparable. For those of you who are looking closely, ask for the details
  behind any numbers you see reported in annual reports, promotional materials,
  or otherwise (including this one!). It is crucial that we don’t settle for
  hand-waving or black-box approaches.

 How Tech Benefits the Environment: The Second Annual Eclipse Carbon Optimization (ECO) Report
</h2>

<p class="mb-2 font-light">
The infrastructure supporting today’s physical industries is outdated and inefficient — and as such — <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700"  href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">accounts for 75% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions</a>.
</p>

<p class="mb-2 font-light">
At <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700"  href="https://eclipse.vc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eclipse</a>, we believe that by digitally transforming the ways we manufacture goods, construct buildings, design transportation and other infrastructure, will meaningfully and positively impact the planet. Digital solutions improve flexibility and precision in large-scale, critical systems, which inherently lead to less waste. We've already seen this with <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700"  href="https://eclipse.vc/blog/accelerating-innovation-martin-feldmann-co-founder-president-and-ceo-of-vulcanforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VulcanForms</a>, whose novel approach to metal additive manufacturing reflexively leads to lower waste versus reductive manufacturing processes. A standard way to measure the impact of various technologies on GHG emissions helps us amplify the positive effects of these solutions.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 font-light">
Today, we’re announcing the second annual Eclipse Carbon Optimization (ECO) report, which provides a novel framework for assessing the potential environmental value of technologies. We found that the 13 Eclipse portfolio companies included in this year’s report have the potential to **reduce annual emissions by 172 MMtCO2e by 2050, or 4% of current total U.S. carbon emissions.** To put that into perspective, just these 13 companies are estimated to reduce emissions generated by 22 million homes.
</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 h2">The ECO Framework</h2>

<p class="mb-2 font-light">
To develop the methodology, we collaborated with <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://rhoimpact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rho Impact</a>, an impact analytics firm, and utilized the <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://www.primecoalition.org/programs/crane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CRANE</a> tool created by Prime Coalition, a prominent climate investment nonprofit, in order to assess the environmental impact of early-stage ventures. This model estimates carbon reduction much like an investor would evaluate an investment’s future revenue and profit potential.
</p>

<p class="mb-4 font-light">
The ECO Framework has three components:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc font-medium">
<li class="mb-2 ml-6">The total estimated GHG emissions produced in the market(s) that the technology addresses.</li>
<li class="mb-2 ml-6">The estimated GHG intensity reduction (%) per unit of the technology.</li>
<li class="mb-4 ml-6">The estimated market penetration rate of the technology.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4 font-light">
The ECO Framework is a big step forward in measuring how technology can reduce carbon emissions. But evaluation is an ongoing and evolving process, given the rapidly changing technology ecosystems. This year, we’ve not only iterated on the methodology, but we’ve also <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="http://eco.rhoimpact.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">open sourced the framework</a>. A key goal of the ECO initiative is to encourage the broader tech community to evaluate the sustainability of technology companies and share feedback.
</p>

<p class="mb-8 font-light">
In order to more thoroughly evaluate the potential positive environmental impact of various technologies, this year’s report also includes a new case study of <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://www.geckorobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gecko Robotics</a>, which falls outside of Eclipse’s portfolio of companies. The inclusion of Gecko in the 2023 ECO report, aims to shed light on the broader landscape of companies driving decarbonization, in addition to showcasing a diverse range of solutions that contribute to a more sustainable future.
</p>

<h2 class="mb-4 h2">Market trends driving a sustainable future</h2>

<p class="mb-6 font-light">
In recent years, five of Eclipse's investment areas — robotics, artificial intelligence, IoT, renewable energy and storage, and advanced semiconductors — have matured and reached important inflection points. The innovative technologies represented in the Eclipse portfolio offer significant economic advantages — these companies generate more revenue for customers, save costs, and improve operational reliability. With ECO, we can now demonstrate that these companies also offer substantial environmental benefits with long-term effects. Here are a few examples:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc font-light">
<li class="mb-2 ml-6"> <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://arcboats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Arc Boats</a>, which is disrupting recreational boating with the most advanced electric boat on the market, <strong>will reduce the carbon intensity of recreational boating by 90.9% per unit. Assuming 10% market penetration, Arc Boats will reduce emissions by 31.1 MMtCO2e annually by 2050.</strong></li>
<li class="mb-2 ml-6"> <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://reliable.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reliable Robotics</a>, by developing safety-enhancing technologies that will prevent fatal aviation accidents, shows a <strong>19% per unit reduction potential, or 2.2 MMtCO2e annually by 2050. This is equivalent to recycling 95 million trash bags of waste.</strong></li>
<li class="mb-8 ml-6"> <a class="font-medium text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700" href="https://www.rideco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RideCo</a> is expanding access to public transport in underserved neighborhoods by enabling municipal transport networks to offer Uber-like customer experiences at a “bus fare” price point. <strong>By shifting commuters from passenger cars to public transit, RideCo can reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 53.1% per passenger mile, or 5.3 MMtCO2e annually by 2050. This is the equivalent of 29,000 railcars worth of coal burned.</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mb-4 h2">Accelerating the Industrial Evolution for economic and environmental prosperity </h2>
<p class="mb-6 font-light">
Eclipse invests in the Industrial Evolution: the thesis that the world’s physical industries must be modernized and digitized, enabling the efficiency, productivity, and sustainability needed to support a growing global population and drive sustained economic growth. Digital transformation will allow the world to achieve its net-zero goals. We see a pathway to a bright future where technology unlocks greater efficiency and prosperity for businesses, as well as safety and longevity to people and the planet.
