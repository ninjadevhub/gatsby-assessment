Rho Impact is excited to partner with LaunchVT, Vermont's flagship
accelerator, to help Vermont's next class of entrepreneurs scale their
businesses, grow their impact, and ultimately win in 'the age of ESG.'
<br/><br/>
Rho Impact and LaunchVT will provide a two-part learning module to inform startups
in LaunchVT's flagship accelerator program on how to integrate ESG strategies
and reporting methodologies in to their businesses. The partnership was made
possible by a grant from BTV Ignite, a local non-profit organization that
helps launch entrepreneurs and grow businesses.
<br/><br/>
LaunchVT's members will
benefit from direct instruction from Noah Miller, co-Founder of Rho Impact and
Chief Advisory Officer, and receive toolkits and frameworks they can integrate
into their business models. The combined Rho Impact and LaunchVT initiative
kicks off on April 26th with an in-person learning session led by Miller at
the Lake Champlain Chamber, with the module concluding on May 3rd. LaunchVT
is meeting the growing trend of ESG as a key element of Vermont's most
innovative companies by accelerating high-growth startups and providing the
tools they need to succeed.
